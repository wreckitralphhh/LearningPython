# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'
alien_color = 'green'

# Write an if statement whether the alien's color is green. If it its, print a message that the player just earned 5 points
if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You've earned 5 points!")

# Write a version that fails the test (this should not output anything)
if alien_color == 'red':
    print("Good guess, but try again :( ")
